# OptoTap PCB

OptoTap PCB is a small, completely unnecessary PCB that exists to make installation of the optical sensor marginally more convenient. (That's right, several of us have spent dozens of hours and hundreds of dollars in order to avoid two solder joints and a bit of heat shrink.)

It comes in two official flavors/form factors:

- **V1**: smaller form factor, 5V only
- **V2**: taller form factor, 5 or 24V capable

Both simplify optical sensor installation by including the necessary current-limiting resistor for the IR led within the sensor itself, as well as providing a visible LED indicator to assist with troubleshooting. 

The V1 board attempts to minimize size and cost as much as possible, at the expense of some flexibility: it **can not be used as a drop-in replacement for 24V inductive sensors** (24V will fry the optical sensor, eventually.)

The V2 board adds a switch-mode regulator to allow safely connecting to 24V probe headers. The regulator converts positive input voltage between >5V and 24V to 5V on-board, at the expense of some additional components and a larger PCB. **Please read important information about previous versions of this board below.**


## OptoTap V1

This version saves some vertical room by requiring you to solder your connector wires directly to the board.

**Do not connect this version to 24V!** (Did we mention that *it's not 24V tolerant???*) Many of the Voron toolhead PCBs in circulation send 24V to the three-pin probe header. You cannot plug this board directly in to these headers!

### Revision history

	- hybrid footprint to permit use of EE-SX398 sensor in addition to Optek versions
	- two-color LED to indicate status and assist with troubleshooting.
	- 'Dark Mode' solder jumper to allow turning off indicator LEDs
	- increased thermal relief on solder pads to make through-holes easier to solder

## OptoTap V2

This version uses an AP63205WU switch mode regulator to drop input voltage and supply 5V to the sensor. This gives a bit of additional room to add a 3-pin JST-PH 2.0mm pitch connector as well [part number S3B-PH-K-S (LF)(SN)].

**IMPORTANT NOTE: The original version of this board had an issue that rendered it unsafe for use at 24V**. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap/issues/42#issuecomment-1370065351) for more extensive details on the testing and resolution of the problem. 

The current version (V2.4) fixes the inrush overvoltage spike that plagued the initial release, and adds several additional safeguards, including a polyfuse and a reverse polarity protection diode.

### Usage notes

#### Operation at 5V

The V2.4 OptoTap PCB has been tested to work fine from 5V to 24V inputs with no modifications. However, this does induce a bit of additional voltage drop from the switching regulator IC going into LDO mode. If you would like to run the V2.4 OptoTap at 5V, my first suggestion would be to just run it at 5V with no modifications. It will most likely work just fine. 

However, it does have the capacity to bypass the whole buck converter circuit. Note that this also bypasses the polyfuse, so there will be no overcurrent protection. 

To make this modification, you need to cut the trace between the center pad and 24V pad on the rear of the PCB, then use some solder to bridge the center pad to the 5V pad. To reverse the change, just desolder that bridge and re-connect the center pad to the 24V pad with more solder.

### Ordering and Assembly notes

#### Inductor choice

I've tested version of this PCB with inductors from Cenker 
CKCS3012-4.7uH/M (C354557) and Microgate 
MPIT3015-4R7M-LF (C486485). Any 30xx footprint coil inductor with >1A current rating and ~ 100 mÎ© DCR should work ok.

#### Indicator LED placement

For some reason, JLCPCB has trouble with their part orientation for this LED specifically. I'm hoping that eventually they will sort their database out. In the meantime, it is worth verifying the part placement prior to assembly.

The footprint silkscreen has two elements to help indicate the orientation of the LED: an extra line on the side to indicate Pin 1, and a little arrow that matches up with a corresponding arrow on the part:

For the v2.4 PCB, make sure that the arrow on the DFM points to the arrow on the footprint, pin 1 matches the extra line on the footprint, and the + pad matches up to the correct pad!

This is how it will look when assembled:

You can see the little bond wires from each of the three LEDs going back to the common anode, which is pretty neat.

***NOTE THAT THE 5V ONLY BOARD (V1.3) HAS A ROTATED FOOTPRINT! YOU'RE WELCOME AND I'M SORRY.***

## Indicator LEDs

The revised boards (V1.3/2.4) now have two-color indicator LEDs to help assist with troubleshooting. This should hopefully help a little bit with troubleshooting. The expected behavior of the LED is:

- Blue: Connected to power, beam not broken
- Red: Connected to power, beam broken

<img src="./images/led_blink.gif" width=480>

When installed in the toolhead, the light should be red normally (toolhead in 'down' position) and blue when activated (toolhead in 'up') position.

I would suggest powering on the board with 5V prior to installing it to make sure everything is functioning as expected. If the indicator LED is red with nothing blocking the optical sensor beam path, there is probably a problem with the ground and signal wires -- triple check!


## Sensor Choice


### Omron or Optek

The revised versions of the boards (V1.3 and V2.4) feature a hybrid optical sensor footprint that permits installation of the Omron EE-SX398 sensor in addition to the Optek OPB666/9xx versions. In testing, the Omron sensor performed just as well as the Optek sensor. 

However, it has a *slightly* different footprint than the Omron sensor, with annoyingly-close leads on the three pin side. I went through a few iterations of testing to come up with a hybrid footprint that seems to work well for either sensor model.

The slots mean there is a little play in sensor positioning, particularly with the EE-SX398 sensor. To help ensure precise alignment with this sensor, print out the jig included in the [STLs](./STLs) folder.


### Sensor Logic

The Tap setup requires a *buffer* style circuit rather than an *inverter* style to ensure safe operation. This style causes the sensor to trigger (pull the signal pin low) when the toolhead is in its normal, 'down' position. That means that if there is a bad connection somewhere, the MCU can observe that there is a problem *without* crashing the toolhead uncontrollably into the build plate.

Please double check your sensor part number to make sure you're getting the appropriate model!

#### For Omron:

- **Good**:
  - EE-SX398
- **Bad**: 
  - EE-SX498

#### For Optek:

- **Good**: 
  - OPB666N
  - OPB9x1
- **Bad**:
  - OPB9x2

Additionally, for the Optek probes, the OPB9x0 sensors are totem pole rather than open collector, meaning that they will pull the sense pin up to 5V when not pulling it down to GND. This can cause problems for some boards (notably RP2040-based CAN toolhead boards) that do not have 5V-tolerant endstop pins.
